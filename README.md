# P2P-File-Sharing-Java

It is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing system as part of the Computer Networks course project. I utilized UDP for overlay network communication and TCP for reliable file transfers. I designed and implemented a user-friendly GUI with advanced features such as folder and file exclusions. I used the Docker tools for the project.

"project_codes" is containing main Java code files

"ready_files_Demo" is containing jar file and docker file and bash file for running project

Xming is needed  for running the Gui.
